# barrel-rotor
A modular rotary analog device that can be used to build information displays. 

## The Big Idea
### Core Principals
We have a lot of information thrown at us through very limited channels.
Think about how many apps send you push notifications every day, or how many windows (browser tabs!) you have open at any one time. Each of these are competing for active time on your screen or in your phone's notifcation feed. However sometimes data needs to be isolated and presented without being rushed to compete.

#### Analog Information Displays Defined
An analog information display must:
* Always be as up-to-date as possible
  * User trust comes through always showing **fresh**, **accurate** data
* Always be inviting, but not pushy
  * For example, a beautiful hand-made wooden enclosure versus a loud siren and a flashing red light
* Support glance-and-go consumption by having leads and hints guiding the user's eye to the data

The barrel rotor will make it easy to draw focus to a single data point. It's job is to bypass traditional channels like push notifications and data on a screen to a physical feedback device that is unabashedly single-purpose.

### Design Goals
* Very few moving parts
* Easy to integrate with a controller, such as an Arduino
* High-fidelity, humanised information delivery
* Out-of-the-box operation is delightful and simple
* All parts can be 3D printed except metal and electronic parts

## Project Tracking
High level work and design items are tracked in Trello. Github issues is used to capture and manage feature requests and bug reports.

## Hardware Links and Resources

## CAD 3D Model
The model lives in Autodesk's tinkercad online CAD editor:

I'm sure there are lots of CAD packages that are way better, but Tinkercad
is the only one I know and it's served my needs so far. I'm open to moving it into another editor if someone is keen to make that happen.

## Bill of Materials
* Arduino Nano
* 28byj-48
* 5mm flat-top UV LED
